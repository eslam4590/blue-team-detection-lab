# Malware Detection Incident Playbook

This playbook defines the response process for a confirmed malware detection
within the Blue Team Detection Lab.

---

## Incident Overview

- **Category:** Malware Infection
- **Typical Severity:** Critical
- **Source Alerts:**
  - Malware hash match
  - Suspicious process execution
  - Endpoint security alerts

---

## Objectives

- Contain the malware spread
- Preserve forensic evidence
- Remove malicious artifacts
- Restore system integrity

---

## Detection Triggers

- Known malicious hash detected
- Execution of malware-related processes
- Abnormal network connections to C2 infrastructure

---

## Investigation Steps

1. Identify infected host(s)
2. Collect endpoint logs
3. Review running processes and persistence mechanisms
4. Check network traffic for lateral movement
5. Determine initial infection vector

---

## Containment Actions

- Isolate affected systems from the network
- Disable compromised user accounts
- Block malicious domains and IPs

---

## Eradication Actions

- Remove malware binaries and persistence mechanisms
- Patch vulnerable software
- Reimage system if required

---

## Recovery Actions

- Restore systems from clean backups
- Reconnect hosts after validation
- Monitor for reinfection indicators

---

## Post-Incident Actions

- Update detection rules and signatures
- Conduct root cause analysis
- Document indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Review incident response effectiveness

---

## Notes

- Malware incidents may involve data exfiltration
- Coordination with management may be required
