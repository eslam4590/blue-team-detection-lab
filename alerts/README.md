# Alerts

This folder documents the alerting layer of the Blue Team Detection Lab.

Alerts represent actionable security signals generated by detection rules
after processing logs and events.

## What is an Alert?

An alert is a security notification created when a detection rule
matches suspicious or malicious behavior.

Alerts are designed to:
- Notify SOC analysts
- Prioritize investigation
- Trigger incident response workflows

## Alert Lifecycle

1. Log Ingestion
2. Detection Rule Match
3. Alert Creation
4. Analyst Triage
5. Escalation to Incident (if required)
6. Closure or False Positive
